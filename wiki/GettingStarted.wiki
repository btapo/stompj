#summary Getting Started with stompJ

= Introduction =

stompJ is an easy and straight forward API and can be used with any Stomp broker. This document is to quickly familiarize with the API and you should be start using it right after reading the document.


= Connection =

The first step before sending or receiving the messages is to establish a connection with the server (or Stomp broker):

{{{
Connection con = new Connection("localhost", 61613, "userid", "password");
con.connect();
}}}

connect() will return null if connection was done successfully. If the connection was rejeced by the server (by sending back and ERROR frame), e.g. because of invalid user/password, an Error object will be returned.

= Sending message =

If you want to send a simple test message, you can use a utility message:

{{{
con.send("Test Message!", "/test/Q1");
}}}

Another way is to create a Message object. With this not only you can set the properties on message but also send binary content:

{{{
DefaultMessage msg = new DefaultMessage();
msg.setProperty("type", "text/plain");
msg.setContentAsString("Another test message!");
con.send(msg, "/test/Q1");
}}}
